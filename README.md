JQuery Maze
- You are stuck in a maze that has 3 rooms
- Using 'w' 'a' 's' 'd' roam around the room and use 'shift' to shoot a beam that reveals walls that may be blocking your path
- Complete the 3 rooms in a certain amount of time and based on the time you will be given score at end
- That score will then be stored at the bottom on a personal leaderboard and you can try and beat that score as many time as you want
- Have fun!
